**Negative Volition**

1.  The Hazards of Negative Volition (-V)
    -------------------------------------

The apostle Paul issued a stern warning to mature Christian believers
living at Ephesus when he told them to beware of falling into a state of
indifference to, or antagonism to, the word of God. He stated that if
they were to become to become negative to the Lord’s teachings, their
lives would very quickly become indistinguishable from those of
unbelievers in terms of fruitfulness and Christian character.

**Ephesians 4:17-19,** "This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord,
that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of
their minds,

having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God
through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their
heart:

who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness,
to work all uncleanness with greediness."

1.  From –V to Total Misery
    -----------------------

1.  The darkness referred to in Ephesians 5:17-19 begins with a negative
    disposition (indifference) toward the word of God.

2.  The decision not to follow the scriptures leads immediately to a
    breakdown in the faith system of understanding divine viewpoint.

3.  There is a cessation in the spiritual growth process; and there is
    actually a total reversal in progress in the Christian life also
    called backsliding or reversion.

4.  As a result of the lack of divine viewpoint in the soul, the
    negative person begins to entertain human standards, human criteria,
    human doctrine, human programs.

5.  These choices plus the full range of Satanic doctrine, are
    substituted for the plan of God.

6.  The further result is subjectivity, unhappiness and deep frustration
    in trying to live by techniques which do not work.

7.  These conditions lead to a frantic search for happiness through
    details of life such as riches, friendships, possessions, human
    approbation, personal influence and power, and so forth.

8.  The believer on this treadmill is a slave to these details of life
    rather than being a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.

9.  While the believer thus engaged is still in Christ positionally, he
    is actually no better off that an unbeliever as far as this life is
    concerned. In fact, he is destined to be far unhappier than the
    unbeliever, as will be shown in the following paragraphs.

10. The time, energy and emotional commitments to this person’s search
    for happiness lead to further isolation from the teachings of the
    word of God.

11. He is spending maximum effort trying to find happiness through other
    means. Thus, the very method for reversing the downward trend is
    ignored!

12. During this process, neuroses and psychoses are being developed,
    aggravated by the self induced misery.

13. These accompany chronic and unrelieved sins of the mind such as
    pride, jealousy, envy, vindictiveness, worry, fear, mental adultery,
    implacability and the like, from which there is no relief outside of
    the plan of God.

14. Because of these sin patterns, divine discipline is compounded
    daily.

15. This believer has a horrible life composed of (1) his own failures,
    (2) doubled and redoubled chastisement, (3) his self-induced
    unhappiness, and (4) the fact that he has no defense against the
    attacks of Satan and his demons.

16. His human righteousness has replaced the divine righteousness of
    God.

But this whole miserable situation is avoidable by returning to a life
of living in the Word of God and being occupied with Christ.
